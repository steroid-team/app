# Week 4

## Yago

At the very beginning of the sprint we had to face the issue with the CI checks not passing in master. I gave some support on the corresponding bug hunt ([#110](https://github.com/steroid-team/app/issues/110)).

Wrapping up the tasks in my backlog from the previous sprint, I have added a code formatter to our codebase, including a CI check ([#113](https://github.com/steroid-team/app/issues/113)). I also implemented the styles from the mockups we prepared last week, effectively giving our app a fresher look and completing all my assigned tasks for this sprint ([#89](https://github.com/steroid-team/app/issues/89), ([#90](https://github.com/steroid-team/app/issues/90)) and ([#91](https://github.com/steroid-team/app/issues/91)), closed via PR ([#118](https://github.com/steroid-team/app/issues/118)).

I also reviewed ([#77](https://github.com/steroid-team/app/issues/77)) (followup), ([#81](https://github.com/steroid-team/app/issues/81)) and ([#112](https://github.com/steroid-team/app/issues/112)), including some aid with the UX details in the latter.

It has been a good week, but I still have to fine-grain my time estimates for design tasks. I also noticed that I tend to spend a lot of time fixing small details, which is especially prone to happen with UI work. Thus, from now on I will try to make sure that my time is invested in alignment with the project’s priorities.
## Leandro
This week, I tried solving the problems with the merging of PR #?. After talking with Théo about it, we decides that the best was to keep it as a draft, and incorporate it later when passing the list selection activity to MVVM. I also started working on the drawing activity. For some unknown reason it doesn't work yet, but I'm confident it should soon. This week I am satisfied with my amount of work, I managed to get well organized.
I also reviewed PR #112.

## Noah

This week I have made a lot of research of documentation about GPS location and I found that the better way to integrate this feature in our app was to use the google maps API. I had some trouble to have access to the API and since I’ve done that late in the week the PR won’t be ready as I wanted. I’ve also done some research to find why we had trouble with our master branch, so that’s why I have started late to work on my sprint tasks this week. I have also reviewed PR  #80 and #110. 

I have badly managed my time this week because of midterm exams in other courses, I have also thought of a too big task for this sprint so I have definitely to improve on this point. 

## Théo (scrum master)

This week I try to fix a problem with the CI. The check wouldn't succeed on the CI but it was working fine locally. So it took some time to deal with it. I also implement the MVVM pattern for the ListSelectionView. It was not very difficult but the more I progressed in the development of this feature, I realized that I need to take care of some other things so it adds again works. I finished my task in the sprint but I need to finish the works that add up.

As we had some PR from the previous sprint, I also tried to do more reviews. I also work on some tasks with Leandro as we had tasks that were close to each other. So we managed to not overlap with the work of the other.

I think this week went well, for me even if there were a lot of works and it was my first experience as a scrum master. For the next week, I need to take into account the testing part as I ran into small problems and so I lost time.
Vincent
This week I contributed to help merging pending PRs, including my own after the CI bug issue was solved. I did a research in how would be the best way to integrate images in our app (in this case the note feature in particular). I wrote the results in a wiki page. I also advanced toward the refactoring of the adapter for the note activity, and the creation of the ViewModel for the notes, but I had less time than usual this week so I couldn’t do a lot of work.

I think overall this week was fine, I might work some more these vacations to catch up with this week.

## Sydney

To be honest I didn't have much time this week to devote to SDP and to work in time as well before the weekly meeting. 
I still managed to review a few PRs : #83, #86 and #113. Some teammates were expressing worries about writing test code and proposed my help if needed.
Tasks this week required more work than expected because I realized that they were dependent on issue #69, which in the end I decided to work on myself in order to finish. Since my assigned tasks required integrating lots of pieces of the app together I had to wait on others to finish their code refactoring.

Some additionnal communication and upfront preparation will be needed in the next sprints.

## Overall team

It was a great week. we have now a great structure (MVVM) for our app and we just kept adding new features. We also focus on sensor usages. This is not fully covered but we made some really good progress in it, and I think in maybe two sprints, all the requirements about sensor usage will be done. With the work of Yago, we also improved a lot the user experience, with a wonderful design.

The main problem of this week was the one with the CI. Some tests keep failing on it even if it was working perfectly locally. So we fell a little behind on the UI tests.

Even if there is no meeting Friday 2th April with the TAs, we will do one between us. I think we have great organization and communication.
Even if we got a lot of work, and some of us had midterms this week, we did great work!
